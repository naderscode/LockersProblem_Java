   Lockers - version 1

	Purpose:This program simulates the "Locker problem". It uses for loops to check for the divisors
			  of each locker number to see if it is odd or even. If it is odd that locker will end up closed.
			  This program outputs the count of lockers that remain open after the game is over,
			  and also outputs a list of all the lockers that are open.
